INTRODUCTION~

Buffergator is a plugin for listing, navigating between, and selecting buffers
to edit. Upon invocation (using the command, ":BuffergatorOpen" or
"BuffergatorToggle", or the provided key mapping, "<Leader>b"), a "catalog" of
listed buffers are displayed in a separate new window split (vertical or
horizontal, based on user options; default = vertical).  From this "buffer
catalog", a buffer can be selected and opened in an existing window, a new
window split (vertical or horizontal), or a new tab page.

Selected buffers can be "previewed", i.e. opened in a window or tab page, but
with focus remaining in the buffer catalog. Even better, you can "walk" up and
down the list of buffers shown in the catalog by using <C-N> (or <SPACE>) /
<C-P> (or <C-SPACE>). These keys select the next/previous buffer in succession,
respectively, opening it for preview without leaving the buffer catalog
viewer.

Buffergator also provides a way to list tab pages and buffers associated with
windows in tab pages (the "tab page catalog", which can be invoked using the
command ":BuffergatorTabsOpen" or the provided key mapping, "<Leader>to").

By default, Buffergator provides global key maps that invoke its main
commands: "<Leader>b" to open and "<Leader>B" to close the buffer catalog, and
"<Leader>to" to open and "<Leader>tc" to close the tab page catalog. If you
prefer to map other keys, or do not want any keys mapped at all, set
"g:buffergator_suppress_keymaps" to 1 in your $VIMRUNTIME.

KEY MAPPINGS (GLOBAL)~

Unless "g:buffergator_suppress_keymaps" is set to 1, then the following
key mappings are defined:

<Leader>b                 Invokes ":BuffergatorOpen": open the buffer catalog,
                          or go to it if it is already open.

<Leader>B                 Invokes ":BuffergatorClose": close the buffer catalog.

<Leader>t, <Leader>to     Invokes ":BuffergatorTabsOpen": open the tab page
                          catalog, or go to it if it is already open.

<Leader>T, <Leader>tc     Invokes ":BuffergatorTabsClose": close the tab page
                          catalog.

gb, <M-B>                 Invokes ":BuffergatorMruCyclePrev": cycle to an
                          older buffer in the most-recently used (MRU) buffer
                          list.  most-recently used buffer. If
                          "g:buffergator_mru_cycle_loop" is set to 1
                          (default), then this will loop, i.e. returning to
                          the initial buffer after reaching the oldest buffer.

gB, <M-S-B>               Invokes ":BuffergatorMruCycleNext": cycle to a newer
                          buffer in the most-recently used (MRU) buffer list.
                          most-recently used buffer. If
                          "g:buffergator_mru_cycle_loop" is set to 1
                          (default), then this will loop, i.e. returning to
                          the oldest buffer after reaching the newest buffer.

]b                        By default, cycles to next buffer by index/number. If
                          g:buffergator_keep_old_mru_switching_keymaps is set
                          to 1, then invokes ":BuffergatorMruCycleNext"
[b                        By default, cycles to preceding buffer by index/number. If
                          g:buffergator_keep_old_mru_switching_keymaps is set
                          to 1, then invokes ":BuffergatorMruCyclePrev"

Unless either "g:buffergator_suppress_keymaps" or
"g:buffergator_suppress_mru_switching_keymaps" is set to 1, then the following
key mappings are defined:

<M-b>   Invokes ":BuffergatorMruCyclePrev"

]b      By default, cycles to next buffer by index/number. If
        g:buffergator_keep_old_mru_switching_keymaps is set to 1, then invokes
        ":BuffergatorMruCycleNext"
[b      By default, cycles to preceding buffer by index/number. If
        g:buffergator_keep_old_mru_switching_keymaps is set to 1, then invokes
        ":BuffergatorMruCyclePrev"

Unless either "g:buffergator_suppress_keymaps" or
"g:buffergator_suppress_mru_switch_into_splits_keymaps" is set to 1, the
following key mappings are defined:

KEY MAPPINGS (BUFFER CATALOG)~

Invoking Buffergator results in the listed buffers being displayed in a
special Buffergator window, which is referred to as a "buffer catalog viewer".
The following key mappings are available when in the viewer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Catalog Management~

cs                  Cycle through sort regimes.
cd                  Cycle through display regimes.
cp                  Toggle showing full paths (only "basename" display regime)
cw                  Cycle through window (viewport) split modes.
cq                  Cycle through quit (autodismiss-on-select) policies.
r                   Update (rebuild/refresh) index.
d                   Delete the selected buffer.
D                   Unconditionally delete the selected buffer.
x                   Wipe the selected buffer.
X                   Unconditionally wipe the selected buffer.
q                   Quit the index/catalog window.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open Selected Buffer~

The following keys all open the currently-selected buffer and switch focus to
it. If the key presses are preceded by a number, then the buffer with that
number will be selected and opened instead of the current buffer. The catalog
buffer will be closed if 'g:buffergator_autodismiss_on_select' evaluates to
true; otherwise it will be kept open.

<CR>, o             Open the currently-selected buffer (or, if [count] is
                    given, buffer with number [count]), in previous window.
s                   Open the currently-selected buffer (or, if [count] is
                    given, buffer with number [count]), in a new vertical
                    split.
<C-V>               As above (compatibility with Ctrl-P/Command-T)
i                   Open the currently-selected buffer (or, if [count] is
                    given, buffer with number [count]), in a new split.
<C-S>               As above (compatibility with Ctrl-P/Command-T)
t                   Open the currently-selected buffer (or, if [count] is
                    given, buffer with number [count]), in a new tab page.
<C-T>               As above (compatibility with Ctrl-P/Command-T)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Preview Selected Buffer~

The following keys all open the currently-selected buffer, but retain focus on
the catalog viewer. If the key presses are preceded by a number, than the
buffer with that number will be opened.

O, go               Preview the currently-selected buffer (or, if [count] is
                    given, buffer with number [count]), in the previous
                    window.
S, gs               Preview the currently-selected buffer (or, if [count] is
                    given, buffer with number [count]), is a new vertical
                    split.
I, gi               Preview the currently-selected buffer (or, if [count] is
                    given, buffer with number [count]), in a new split
T                   Preview the currently-selected buffer (or, if [count] is
                    given, buffer with number [count]), in a new tab
                    page.
<SPACE>, <C-N>      Go to the next buffer entry (or, if [count] is
                    given, buffer with number [count]), and preview it in the
                    previous window.
<C-SPACE>, <C-P>    Go to the previous buffer entry (or, if [count] is
                    given, buffer with number [count]), and preview it in the
                    previous window.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open and Switch Focus to Selected Buffer~

The following keys all open the currently-selected buffer and switch focus to
it, keeping the catalog viewe open, regardless of the
'g:buffergator_autodismiss_on_select' setting. If the key presses are preceded
by a number, than the buffer with that number will be opened.

po                  Open the currently-selected buffer (or, if [count] is
                    given, buffer with number [count]), in the previous
                    window, and switch focus to it, keeping the catalog
                    viewer open.
ps                  Open the currently-selected buffer (or, if [count] is
                    given, buffer with number [count]), is a new vertical
                    split, and switch focus to it, keeping the catalog
                    viewer open.
pi                  Open the currently-selected buffer (or, if [count] is
                    given, buffer with number [count]), in a new split,
                    and switch focus to it, keeping the catalog
                    viewer open.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Go to Existing Viewport Showing Buffer~

The following keys will try to find the selected buffer in an existing
viewport (whether on the current tab page or another). If the key presses are
preceded by a number, then the buffer with that number will be the target
buffer.

eo                  If currently-selected buffer (or, if [count] is
                    given, buffer with number [count]), is showing in an existing
                    viewport on this or any other tab page, go to it;
                    otherwise show it in the previous window.
es                  If currently-selected buffer (or, if [count] is
                    given, buffer with number [count]), is showing in an existing
                    viewport on this or any other tab page, go to it;
                    otherwise show it in a new vertical split.
ei                  If currently-selected buffer (or, if [count] is
                    given, buffer with number [count]), is showing in an existing
                    viewport on this or any other tab page, go to it;
                    otherwise show it in a new horizontal split.
et                  If currently-selected buffer (or, if [count] is
                    given, buffer with number [count]), is showing in an existing
                    viewport on this or any other tab page, go to it;
                    otherwise show it in a new tab page.
E                   If currently-selected buffer (or, if [count] is
                    given, buffer with number [count]), is showing in an existing
                    viewport on this or any other tab page, go to it;
                    otherwise do nothing.

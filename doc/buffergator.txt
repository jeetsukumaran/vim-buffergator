INTRODUCTION~

Buffergator is a plugin for listing, navigating between, and selecting buffers
to edit. Upon invocation (using the command, ":BuffergatorOpen" or
"BuffergatorToggle", or the provided key mapping, "<Leader>b"), a "catalog" of
listed buffers are displayed in a separate new window split (vertical or
horizontal, based on user options; default = vertical).  From this "buffer
catalog", a buffer can be selected and opened in an existing window, a new
window split (vertical or horizontal), or a new tab page.

Selected buffers can be "previewed", i.e. opened in a window or tab page, but
with focus remaining in the buffer catalog. Even better, you can "walk" up and
down the list of buffers shown in the catalog by using <C-N> (or <SPACE>) /
<C-P> (or <C-SPACE>). These keys select the next/previous buffer in succession,
respectively, opening it for preview without leaving the buffer catalog
viewer.

Buffergator also provides a way to list tab pages and buffers associated with
windows in tab pages (the "tab page catalog", which can be invoked using the
command ":BuffergatorTabsOpen" or the provided key mapping, "<Leader>t").

By default, Buffergator provides global key maps that invoke its main
commands: "<Leader>b" to open and "<Leader>B" to close the buffer catalog, and
"<Leader>t" to open and "<Leader>T" to close the tab page catalog. If you
prefer to map other keys, or do not want any keys mapped at all, set
"g:buffergator_suppress_keymaps" to 1 in your $VIMRUNTIME.

KEY MAPPINGS (GLOBAL)~

Unless "g:buffergator_suppress_keymaps" is set to 1, then the following
key mappings are defined:

<Leader>b           Invokes ":BuffergatorOpen": open the buffer catalog, or go
                    to it if it is already open.

<Leader>B           Invokes ":BuffergatorClose": close the buffer catalog.

<Leader>t           Invokes ":BuffergatorTabsOpen": open the tab page catalog,
                    or go to it if it is already open.

<Leader>T           Invokes ":BuffergatorTabsClose": close the tab page
                    catalog.

[b, <M-B>           Invokes ":BuffergatorMruCyclePrev": cycle to an older
                    buffer in the most-recently used (MRU) buffer list.
                    most-recently used buffer. If
                    "g:buffergator_mru_cycle_loop" is set to 1 (default), then
                    this will loop, i.e. returning to the initial buffer after
                    reaching the oldest buffer.

]b, <M-S-B>         Invokes ":BuffergatorMruCycleNext": cycle to a newer
                    buffer in the most-recently used (MRU) buffer list.
                    most-recently used buffer. If
                    "g:buffergator_mru_cycle_loop" is set to 1 (default), then
                    this will loop, i.e. returning to the oldest buffer after
                    reaching the newest buffer.

KEY MAPPINGS (BUFFER CATALOG)~

Invoking Buffergator results in the listed buffers being displayed in a
special Buffergator window, which is referred to as a "buffer catalog viewer".
The following key mappings are available when in the viewer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Catalog Management~

cs                  Cycle through sort regimes.
cd                  Cycle through display regimes.
cp                  Toggle showing full paths (only "basename" display regime)
cw                  Cycle through window (viewport) split modes.
cq                  Cycle through quit (autodismiss-on-select) policies.
r                   Update (rebuild/refresh) index.
d                   Delete the selected buffer.
D                   Unconditionally delete the selected buffer.
x                   Wipe the selected buffer.
X                   Unconditionally wipe the selected buffer.
q                   Quit the index/catalog window.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open Selected Buffer~

The following keys all open the currently-selected buffer and switch focus to
it. If the key presses are preceded by a number, then the buffer with that
number will be selected and opened instead of the current buffer. The catalog
buffer will be closed if 'g:buffergator_autodismiss_on_select' evaluates to
true; otherwise it will be kept open.

<CR>, o             Open the currently-selected buffer (or, if [count] is
                    given, buffer with number [count]), in previous window.
s                   Open the currently-selected buffer (or, if [count] is
                    given, buffer with number [count]), in a new vertical
                    split.
<C-V>               As above (compatibility with Ctrl-P/Command-T)
i                   Open the currently-selected buffer (or, if [count] is
                    given, buffer with number [count]), in a new split.
<C-S>               As above (compatibility with Ctrl-P/Command-T)
t                   Open the currently-selected buffer (or, if [count] is
                    given, buffer with number [count]), in a new tab page.
<C-T>               As above (compatibility with Ctrl-P/Command-T)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Preview Selected Buffer~

The following keys all open the currently-selected buffer, but retain focus on
the catalog viewer. If the key presses are preceded by a number, than the
buffer with that number will be opened.

O, go               Preview the currently-selected buffer (or, if [count] is
                    given, buffer with number [count]), in the previous
                    window.
S, gs               Preview the currently-selected buffer (or, if [count] is
                    given, buffer with number [count]), is a new vertical
                    split.
I, gi               Preview the currently-selected buffer (or, if [count] is
                    given, buffer with number [count]), in a new split
T                   Preview the currently-selected buffer (or, if [count] is
                    given, buffer with number [count]), in a new tab
                    page.
<SPACE>, <C-N>      Go to the next buffer entry (or, if [count] is
                    given, buffer with number [count]), and preview it in the
                    previous window.
<C-SPACE>, <C-P>    Go to the previous buffer entry (or, if [count] is
                    given, buffer with number [count]), and preview it in the
                    previous window.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open and Switch Focus to Selected Buffer~

The following keys all open the currently-selected buffer and switch focus to
it, keeping the catalog viewe open, regardless of the
'g:buffergator_autodismiss_on_select' setting. If the key presses are preceded
by a number, than the buffer with that number will be opened.

po                  Open the currently-selected buffer (or, if [count] is
                    given, buffer with number [count]), in the previous
                    window, and switch focus to it, keeping the catalog
                    viewer open.
ps                  Open the currently-selected buffer (or, if [count] is
                    given, buffer with number [count]), is a new vertical
                    split, and switch focus to it, keeping the catalog
                    viewer open.
pi                  Open the currently-selected buffer (or, if [count] is
                    given, buffer with number [count]), in a new split,
                    and switch focus to it, keeping the catalog
                    viewer open.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Go to Existing Viewport Showing Buffer~

The following keys will try to find the selected buffer in an existing
viewport (whether on the current tab page or another). If the key presses are
preceded by a number, then the buffer with that number will be the target
buffer.

eo                  If currently-selected buffer (or, if [count] is
                    given, buffer with number [count]), is showing in an existing
                    viewport on this or any other tab page, go it it;
                    otherwise show it in the previous window.
es                  If currently-selected buffer (or, if [count] is
                    given, buffer with number [count]), is showing in an existing
                    viewport on this or any other tab page, go it it;
                    otherwise show it in a new vertical split.
ei                  If currently-selected buffer (or, if [count] is
                    given, buffer with number [count]), is showing in an existing
                    viewport on this or any other tab page, go it it;
                    otherwise show it in a new horizontal split.
et                  If currently-selected buffer (or, if [count] is
                    given, buffer with number [count]), is showing in an existing
                    viewport on this or any other tab page, go it it;
                    otherwise show it in a new tab page.
E                   If currently-selected buffer (or, if [count] is
                    given, buffer with number [count]), is showing in an existing
                    viewport on this or any other tab page, go it it;
                    otherwise do nothing.

Open Selected Tab Page or Tab Page Window~

The following keys all open the currently-selected tab page or window.

<CR>, o             Open the currently-selected tab page or window.
<SPACE>             Select the next tab page entry.
<C-SPACE>           Select the previous tab page entry.

OPTIONS AND SETTINGS~

The following options can be used to customize the behavior of this plugin:

g:buffergator_viewport_split_policy~
    Default: "L"
    Determines how a new Buffergator window will be opened. Can be one of the
    following values:
        "L"   : vertical left (full screen height)
        "R"   : vertical right (full screen height)
        "T"   : horizontal top (full screen width)
        "B"   : horizontal bottom (full screen width)

g:buffergator_autodismiss_on_select~
    Default: 1
    If true, then selection an entry with <CR> will close the catalog. Otherwise,
    catalog stays open. Default is 1.

g:buffergator_autoexpand_on_split~
    Default: 1
    If true and running in GUI mode, then the application screen will be expanded
    to accommodate the Buffergator window.

g:buffergator_autoupdate~
    Default: 0
    If true, then the Buffergator window will be updated when the buffer list
    changes.

g:buffergator_split_size~
    Default: 40
    If greater than 0, this will be the width of the Buffergator window in any
    vertical splitting mode, or its height in any horizontal splitting mode.

g:buffergator_vsplit_size~
    Default: 40
    If greater than 0, this will be the width of the Buffergator window in
    any vertical splitting mode.

g:buffergator_hsplit_size~
    Default: 20
    If greater than 0, this will be the height of the Buffergator window in
    any horizontal splitting mode.

g:buffergator_sort_regime~
    Default: "bufnum"
    Sets the default sort regime for buffer listing:
        "bufnum" : sort by buffer number [default]
        "basename": sort by buffer file basename (followed by directory)
        "filepath": sort by full buffer filepath
        "extension": sort by buffer filename extension (followed by full
                    filepath)
        "mru": sort by most recently used

g:buffergator_display_regime~
    Default: "basename"
    Sets the default display regime for buffer listing:
        "basename": display buffer basename first,
                    followed by directory [default]
        "filepath": display full buffer filepath
        "bufname": display buffer name

g:buffergator_show_full_directory_path~
    Default: 1
    If true, then show the full path of each buffer. Otherwise, show the
    relative path.
    Only relevant when the display regime is "basename".

g:buffergator_suppress_keymaps~
    Default: 0
    If true, then Buffergator will not automatically map "<Leader>b" to
    open the Buffergator catalog and "<Leader>B" to close it.

g:buffergator_mru_cycle_local_to_window~
    Default: 1
    If true, then the most recently used list will include only buffers
    within the window.  Otherwise, it will incude all buffers.
